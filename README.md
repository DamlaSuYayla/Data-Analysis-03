A data-driven study analyzing the impact of renewable energy consumption on GDP growth in the United Kingdom.

This study examined the relationship between renewable and waste-based energy consumption and 
economic growth in the United Kingdom. The analyses showed that economic growth exhibited a 
fluctuating pattern and that the impact of renewable energy components was not linear. The Random 
Forest model provided more accurate predictions compared to the Linear Regression and Gradient 
Boosting, and feature significance analysis within the model revealed that wind, solar, and hydroelectric 
energy had a stronger impact on economic growth than other energy types. The study demonstrates that 
the energy-growth relationship is dynamic and that the impact of each energy type can vary; therefore, 
it is recommended that policymakers develop energy strategies by evaluating them on a type-by-type 
basis.
